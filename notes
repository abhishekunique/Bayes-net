-- also way for people to label our own stuff
use 4 arrow crosshair for dragging
look into svg vs canvas -- a bit dangerous
need to pick a single psuedocode tracking method
recursive functions -- repeat the code?
-- link to pgbovine's python tutor


notes for backtracking: should have function name up to so more obvious
recursion
perhaps something more informative for recursive depth
need all cases: found w/ backtracking, found w/o, and didnt find at all


graph drawer
-- a circle to click on for vertexs
-- directed/undir edges
-- draggable vertices
-- snap-to grid
-- automated graph generation
---- graphdracula layout algorithm

search trees
-- need to handle space better somehow
-- perhaps highlight the goal 
-- precomupute the tree and resize it to figure out how big things can be
---- look into setviewbox in raphel
-- have a warning that you won;t be able to read the tree if graph isn't nice
-- 

pacman minimax

-- should visually notify when resetting to start state when checking a new
action
-- use minimax drawing from cs 188 stuff
-- slides have two sets of pseudocode for minimax
---- alphabeta more explicit about assigning values
---- should use a style more similar to alphabeta
-- show variable state?

game of d sep
-- needs to use soemthing to generate layouts, probably graphdracula
